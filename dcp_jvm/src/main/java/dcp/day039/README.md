Conway's Game of Life takes place on an infinite two-dimensional board of square cells.
Each cell is either dead or alive, and at each tick, the following rules apply:

1. Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours remains living.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
5. A cell neighbours another cell if it is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

Implement Conway's Game of Life.
It should be able to be initialized with a starting list of live cell coordinates.

The original description requested a number of steps to which to run for and output instructions, but instead,
I have implemented a visualization using Java Swing that runs for infinitely long until the window is closed.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
There is no testing code for this problem as it is random and visualized.
