## Chapter 13-2: Number of ways to decode a string

Given a mapping `a = 1`, `b = 2`, ..., `z = 26`, and an encoded string, count the
number of ways that it can be decoded.

For example, the message `111` should be 3, since it could be decoded as `aaa`, `ka`, and `ak`.

You can assume that the messages are always decodable. For example, `001` is not allowed.
