This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a pivot `x`, and a list `lst`, partition the list into three parts.

1. The first part contains all elements in lst that are less than `x`.

2. The second part contains all elements in lst that are equal to `x`.

3. The third part contains all elements in lst that are larger than `x`.

Ordering within a part can be arbitrary.

For example, given `x = 10` and `lst = [9, 12, 3, 5, 14, 10, 10]`, one partition may be `[9, 3, 5, 10, 10, 12, 14]`.
