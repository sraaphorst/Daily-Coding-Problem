# Daily Coding Problem

These are some practice problems solved in a variety of different languages (depending on the question specification and on my whims) from the Daily Coding Problem challenge:

Here is a brief description of each problem solved so far and a link to the problem in the repo.

The following problems are implemented in C++:

## Day 1 \[Easy\]

Given a list and a goal sum, find if two elements in the list sum up to the goal.

Implemented in C++: [Day 1](dcp_cpp/src/day001)

## Day 2 \[Hard\]

Given a list `L`, create a new list `L'` where `L'[i]` is the product of all elements of `L` except `L[i]`.

Implemented in C++: [Day 2](dcp_cpp/src/day002)

## Day 3 \[Medium\]

Create a binary tree `Node` in Python that is serializable and deserializable.

Implemented in Python: [Day 3](dcp_py/day003)

## Day 5 \[Medium\]

Working with `cons`, `car`, and `cdr`.

Implemented in Python: [Day 5](dcp_py/day005)

## Day 8 \[Easy\]

Counting unival subtrees.

Implemented in Scala: [Day 8](dcp_jvm/src/main/scala/dcp/day008)

## Day 12 \[Hard\]

Given a staircase of `N` steps and a list `L` of possible step jumps, find the number of ways to ascend the steps.

Implemented in C++: [Day 12](dcp_cpp/src/day012)

## Day 27 \[Easy\]

Given a string made of parentheses `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `(`, and `)`,
determine if it is balanced.

Implemented in C++: [Day 27](dcp_cpp/src/day027)

## Day 28 \[Medium\]

Given a list of words `L` and a line length `k` (with each word at
most length `k`), break the words into full-padded lines of length `k`
with excess padding given to left words.

Implemented in Python: [Day 28](dcp_py/day028)

## Day 29 \[Easy\]

Run-length encoding and decoding of strings.

Implemented in Scala: [Day 29](dcp_jvm/src/main/scala/dcp/day029)

## Day 30 \[Medium\]

Elevation water pooling.

Implemented in C++: [Day 30](dcp_cpp/day30)

## Day 31 \[Easy\]

Computing word edit distance

Implemented in Python: [Day 31](dcp_py/day031)

## Day 35 \[Hard\]

Sort a string of `R`s, `G`s, and `B`s  so that all `R`s are on the
left, followed by all `G`s, and then by all `B`s.

Implemented in C++: [Day 35](dcc_cpp/day35)
