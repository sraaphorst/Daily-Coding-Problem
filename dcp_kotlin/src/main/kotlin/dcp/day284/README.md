# Day 284 \[Medium\]

This problem was asked by Yext.

Two nodes in a binary tree can be called cousins if they are on the same level of the tree but have different parents. For example, in the following diagram `4` and `6` are cousins.

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \   \
4   5   6
```
Given a binary tree and a particular node, find all cousins of that node.

**NOTE:** My solution finds all cousins, and not just those of a particular node.
