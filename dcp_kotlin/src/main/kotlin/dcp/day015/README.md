This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a stream of elements too large to store in memory, pick a random element from the stream with uniform probability.

**Note:** There is no real concrete way to test this method via uniform or specification
testing, so we provide a main function that picks uniformly from a sequence of 10 elements.
Verifying that the results are "near" each other the majority of the time should suffices as a sanity
check that the algorithm works.
